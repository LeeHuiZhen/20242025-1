Course Reflection

Looking back on my experience in SECP1513, I realize just how much I’ve learned about information systems and technology (IS/IT). This course gave me a solid introduction to how technology is used both at home and in the workplace. We covered everything from hardware and software to networks and communication, and I got plenty of hands-on experience through lab work, where I learned the basics of PC installation and productivity tools.

One of the biggest takeaways from this course was understanding how different components of IS/IT work together. Learning about system structures and how technology is applied in various industries helped me appreciate the role of IT in daily life. This has been especially valuable for me as a bioinformatics student, where technology plays a key role in managing and analyzing biological data.

Another highlight of SECP1513 was the industry visits and guest talks. Getting to hear from professionals in the field and seeing real-world applications of what we were learning made a huge difference. It helped me understand what working in IT is really like and gave me insights into career paths I might be interested in.

Speaking of careers, one of the course requirements was to explore job roles and industry expectations. This was a great way to get a clearer idea of the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in IT-related fields. It made me more aware of the importance of staying updated with industry trends and constantly improving my technical abilities.

Beyond technical skills, SECP1513 also reinforced the importance of integrity in IT. We discussed responsible technology use, data security, and intellectual property rights—topics that are essential for anyone working with digital tools and systems to understand.

Overall, this course was a great experience. It wasn’t just about learning theories—it was about seeing how they apply in the real world. While we didn’t focus on coding, I still gained valuable insights into IT systems and their impact. I feel more confident in my understanding of technology, and I’m excited to keep building on the foundation SECP1513 has given me as I continue my studies and move toward a career in technology.
